A quick hack and proof of concept for a Facebook Timeline App that publishes git commits to Timeline.

To see this in action

1. go to http://post-receive-hook.snap-interactive.com
2. grant permissions
3. follow the instructions on that page!

If you were actually to attempt to make a version of this yourself, you would need to do the following...

1. rename classes/sample.AppInfo.php to classes/AppInfo.php and populate relevant values.
2. probably not use such a goofy datastore.
3. create an app on facebook and configure a bunch of stuff in the Open Graph Editor.

When timeline goes live to everyone, this will be actually usable! Hopefully that happens soon.
